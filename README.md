# ComfyEz

**ComfyEz** is a modern, feature-rich web interface designed to interact with a local [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) instance. 

It abstracts the complex node-based graph into a sleek, professional "Playground" UI (similar to commercial AI generators) while retaining the flexibility of ComfyUI through a powerful **Workflow & Node Mapping** system. It also integrates **LLM capabilities** for prompt engineering and complex inpainting tools.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Core Generation
- **Sleek Interface**: A dark-themed, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **Param Controls**: Easy access to Steps, CFG, Sampler, Scheduler, Seed, Dimensions, and Batch Size.
- **LoRA Support**: Dynamic LoRA loading and stacking. The system automatically chains LoRA nodes (Model/CLIP) sequentially in the backend workflow.
- **Upscaling**: Toggleable upscaling support (Lanczos, Bicubic, etc.) with custom scale factors.

### 🧠 Workflow System
- **Preset Management**: Save, Import, and Export different ComfyUI workflows (JSON).
- **Node Mapping Engine**: Map UI controls (e.g., "Seed Slider") to specific Node IDs in your workflow JSON without touching code.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Works with standard SDXL, SD1.5, Flux, or custom workflows provided they are mapped correctly.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Prompting (LLM Integration)
Integrates with OpenAI-compatible APIs (OpenRouter, OpenAI, local LLMs) to supercharge creativity:
- **Prompt Enhancement**: One-click rewrite of prompts with adjustable intensity (Low/Medium/High).
- **Prompt Suggestions**: Get 3 creative variations based on a simple concept.
- **Chat-to-Edit**: Conversational interface to modify prompts (e.g., "Make it night time").
- **Image-to-Prompt (Vision)**: Upload an image to extract a detailed prompt using Vision models.
- **Variant Generator**: Generate categorization matrices (Lighting, Style, Camera) to explore different artistic directions.

### 🖌️ Advanced Inpainting
A dedicated, fully-featured inpainting editor:
- **Brush Controls**: Adjustable brush size and feathering (softness).
- **Visual Feedback**: "Lemon Pattern" overlay to clearly see masked areas against dark images.
- **Pan & Zoom**: Infinite canvas navigation (Space + Drag).
- **Undo/Redo**: Full history stack for mask strokes.
- **Auto-Injection**: Automatically injects "Load Image", "Load Mask", "VAE Encode", and "Set Latent Noise Mask" nodes into workflows that aren't explicitly designed for inpainting.

### ⚡ Smart Queue & History
- **Persistent Queue**: The generation queue survives page reloads (stored in IndexedDB).
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatically resumes checking status for pending jobs after a browser refresh.
- **Batch Management**: Reorder, delete, or clear queue items.
- **Visual History**: Gallery view of all generated images with full metadata.
- **"Remix" Capability**: Click any history item to instantly restore all parameters, workflows, and seeds used to generate it.

### 💾 Persistence
- **IndexedDB**: Stores high-resolution images, generation history, and queue state locally within the browser (no external database required).
- **Local Storage**: Saves user preferences, API keys (locally only), and active workflow selections.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)
- **State/Logic**: Custom Hooks (`useComfy`, `useWorkflows`), Context-free architecture.
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (via native API), LocalStorage.
- **Backend Integration**: Direct fetch calls to ComfyUI API (`/prompt`, `/history`, `/upload`, `/object_info`).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **ComfyUI**: You must have [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) running locally.
   - Default address: `http://127.0.0.1:8188`
   - **CORS Note**: You may need to run ComfyUI with `--enable-cors-header *` if accessing from a different origin.
2. **Node.js**: Version 18+ recommended.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/comfy-ez.git
   cd comfy-ez
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### connecting to ComfyUI
1. Click the **Settings (Gear)** icon in the sidebar.
2. Set **Host URL** to your ComfyUI instance (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8188`).

### Setting up LLM Features
1. In Settings, enable **LLM Config**.
2. **API Host**: Defaults to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` (or use `https://api.openai.com/v1`).
3. **API Key**: Enter your key (stored locally in browser).
4. **Model**: Click "Fetch List" to grab available models or type one manually (e.g., `google/gemini-2.0-flash`, `gpt-4o`).

## 🧩 How Workflow Mapping Works

This app allows you to use *any* ComfyUI workflow by "mapping" generic UI controls to specific Node IDs.

1. Open the **Workflow Editor** (Fork icon in sidebar).
2. **Import** a ComfyUI JSON file (Save as API Format from ComfyUI).
3. The **JSON Editor** on the right shows the raw graph.
4. The **Mapping Column** on the right allows you to select which node corresponds to:
   - **Prompt Node**: Where the positive text goes.
   - **Model Node**: Where the checkpoint is loaded.
   - **Seed/Steps/CFG**: Usually the KSampler node.
   - **Preview Node**: The final image output node.
5. **Save** the preset. The UI will now control that specific workflow.

## ⌨️ Shortcuts & Tips

- **Queue Generation**: `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter`) in the prompt box.
- **Inpainting**:
  - `Space + Drag`: Pan the canvas.
  - `Scroll Wheel`: Zoom in/out.
  - `Ctrl + Z`: Undo mask stroke.
  - `[ / ]`: Decrease/Increase brush size (if implemented) or use UI sliders.
- **Drag & Drop**: Drop an image onto the sidebar to load it as an Input Image (Img2Img). Drop it onto the Canvas to view it.
